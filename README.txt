There are still some days left for Clyde's death, however I'd like to point some things out.
There are 2 new files called AI21Chat.hx and AI21Request.hx, these are requests for AI21's language model, Jurassic-2.

This model is WAY DUMBER than GPT-3.5 and I wouldn't recommend using it unless you cannot use OpenAI anymore
In order to use it, change your config.json file and add 2 new parameters.
- "ai21: true"
- "ai21_token: "your token here""
