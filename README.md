# Clyde AI recreated

This is a very close recreation of the Discord's AI chatbot, Clyde!

## Why is this a thing?
Clyde is going to shut down at December 1st and we will no longer be able to interact with him.... unless..?

### How do I use this and what can it do?
First of all I wanna say that this is **against** Discord's ToS and you should not use this with your main account as it might get permanently banned.

This script works by passing in a user account token and it will pretty much act like Clyde, by using its same exact prompt that Clyde does.
Just make another Discord account with the name of Clyde and its profile picture, pass in the token and have fun, you now have Clyde again and you will be able to interact with him.

This works for servers and group chats, and you can bring Clyde to any Discord server since it's a user account, it doesn't require you to have any permissions to do so.

To build this bot and be able to use it, just download Haxe 4.3.1 and Git from https://git-scm.com

- Download the following libraries by typing these commands on the terminal
   - `haxelib git hxdiscord https://github.com/FurretDev/hxdiscord`

After that just type `haxe build.hxml` and a new neko file should appear, to start it just type in `neko main.n`
You also need a OpenAI token, for it to be able to talk.

- This replica of Clyde doesn't have gif search, basic calculator or any of the tools that the old Clyde used to have, I will implement these on the future, but for now, you can pretty much talk to him!
